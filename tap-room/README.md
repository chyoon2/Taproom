As a patron, I want to check a book out, so that I can take it home with me.

As a patron, I want to know how many copies of a book are on the shelf, so that I can see if any are available. (Hint: make a copies table; a book should have many copies.)

- a search to find a book. 
- in details of a book - show how many copies of a book there are left
- where are we adding copies?(ie into our copies table) on our website.  
    - in copies create, viewbagbookname and "add/submit" a copy in the table.
- 
-be able to obtain and pass a copyId.
-be able to find first copyid that isnt already checked out. in controller.
-change that copyid record to true.
-
